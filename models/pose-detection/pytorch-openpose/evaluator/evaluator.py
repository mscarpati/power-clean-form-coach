####### HOW LIFTS ARE EVALUATED #######
## Lifter's angles/values are compared to optimal angles/values above
## Error margin will be defined as 110% of the standard deviation of optimal angles/values from dataset
## Area of error will be circled/highlighted on a color scheme in accordance with how unoptimal it is (red-orange-yellow)
## Error messages will be displayed based on the error margin (put in separate file probably can be .txt)
